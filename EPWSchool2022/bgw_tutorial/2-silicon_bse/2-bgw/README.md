# Silicon (2) - 2-bgw

In this directory, we will perform all the GW/GW-BSE calculations using
BerkeleyGW.


## Instruction

1. First, run the script `./01-link_files.sh`. It will create links for the
   `epsmat.h5` (dielectric matrix) files and the bsemat (BSE kernel) files.

2. Go to each directory in the numeric order they appear and follow the
   instructions in each `README.md`.
