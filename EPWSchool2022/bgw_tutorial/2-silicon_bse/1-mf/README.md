# Silicon (2) - 1-mf

In this directory, we will perform all the mean-field calculations for
BerkeleyGW. 


## Instruction

1. First, run the script `./01-link_files.sh`. It will create links for the
   charge density, pseudopotentials, exchange-correlation matrix elements, and
   WFN files.

2. Go to each directory in the numeric order they appear and follow the
   instructions in each `README.md` file.
